* local OS X install, R 3.3.2
* win-builder (devel and release)
* R-hub (Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS, R-release, GCC; Fedora Linux, R-devel, clang, gfortran; Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1, R-devel, 32/64 bit)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs, or NOTEs when checked on local OX install. 

There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs when checked on win-builder or on most R-hub checkers. There was one NOTE commonly across checks:

* Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:

  + McGough (10:359)
  + Nowcasting (2:8)
  + al (10:370)
  + et (10:367)
  + nowcasts (10:277)
    
These words are not mis-spelled.

There was one ERROR for R-hub checked on Fedora Linux, R-devel, clang, gfortran: 

* configure: error: "automatic detection of JAGS failed. Please use pkg-config to locate the JAGS library. See the INSTALL file for details."

This error is because JAGS is required to be installed on the system before installation of `rjags`.
This is noted in the README.md and help files.
